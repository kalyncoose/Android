- Instagram Survey:
	- 43% - Using standard Google Compose navigation
	- 36% - Using a 3rd party navigation library
	- 20% - Using a custom built navigation solution
- **Official Jetpack Compose Navigation**: 
	- Advantages include Google support and good documentation, but drawbacks include reliance on route strings, limited type safety for navigation arguments, and boilerplate code.
- **Using Navigation Libraries (e.g., Compose Destinations)**: 
	- Advantages include reduced boilerplate code, type-safe navigation arguments, and advanced features like custom animations. However, drawbacks may include longer build times, potential build errors, and reliance on third-party libraries.
- **Building Custom Navigation System**: 
	- Advantages include tailor-made solutions for specific app needs and minimal dependency on third-party libraries. However, it requires significant initial effort and ongoing maintenance.
 - **Using Fragments with XML Navigation and Compose Views**: 
	 - This approach involves leveraging the mature features of the Navigation Component for XML while building UIs with Jetpack Compose. Advantages include feature richness, type-safe arguments, and complex animations. However, it reintroduces boilerplate code with fragments.
