- A coroutine can be used for easy multi-threading in Kotlin
- Coroutines are first-class functionality in Kotlin meaning they are highly supported and flexible just like a regular `var` variable
- Coroutines can be executed within an existing thread
- Coroutines are suspendable
- Coroutines can switch their context (move from one thread to another)
- Very similar to "Goroutines" in Go/Golang
