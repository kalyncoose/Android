- Rule of 3 or 1-2 Factor: As soon as you see third occurrence of same code, refactor it to improve reusability
- Don't comment what happens: only leave comments on why something happens, ensure variable names and logic is readable
- Don't be afraid of long names: ensure purpose of function/variable is understandable from name
- Avoid genius code: readability is a higher goal over small performance gains
- Law of Demeter: Make class variables private and expose necessary functionality out of it
- Avoid side effects: Something changes outside of the expected scope
- Avoid if/else: Use return statements earlier/more often
- Features should have:
	- Low coupling - features communicate to each other minimally
	- High cohesion - each feature is highly specialized, uses what it provides for itself
- Separation of concerns: divide your app into multiple layers where each layer has a clear purpose
	- Example: data (model), domain (business logic), presentation (UI)
- Follow DRY and SOLID principles
